# **1. Channel Models**

Wireless communication channels are inherently unpredictable and vary across time, frequency, and space due to the dynamic nature of the propagation environment. Accurate channel modeling is essential for designing and evaluating modern communication systems, particularly in 5G and beyond. This chapter provides an overview of wireless channel characteristics, common models, and their simulation techniques.

---

## **1.1 Wireless Channel Characteristics**
Wireless channels exhibit unique characteristics due to the interaction between transmitted signals and the surrounding environment. The primary factors affecting wireless channels are:

!!! note "small-scale fading"
    
    ### **1.1.1 Multipath Propagation**
    - **Definition**: Signals from a transmitter reach the receiver via multiple paths caused by reflection, diffraction, and scattering.
    - **Impacts**:
    
        - **Constructive or destructive interference**: Leads to signal fading.
        - **Delay spread**: Causes inter-symbol interference (ISI).
        - **Frequency selectivity**: Variations in channel gain across different frequencies.
    
    ### **1.1.2 Doppler Effect**
    - **Definition**: Frequency shift caused by the relative motion between transmitter and receiver.
    - **Impacts**:
        
        - **Doppler spread**: Results in time-selective fading.
        - **Coherence time**: Defines how long the channel remains static.

!!! note "large-scale fading"
    
    ### **1.1.3 Shadowing**
    - **Definition**: Signal attenuation caused by large obstacles (e.g., buildings, mountains).
    - **Modeling**:
    
          - Typically modeled as a log-normal distribution over distance.
    
    ### **1.1.4 Path Loss**
    - **Definition**: Reduction in signal power as it propagates through space.
    
    - **Impacts**:
      
          - Determines the communication range.
          - Dominates over large distances.

---

## **1.2 Wireless Channel Classification**
Wireless channels are commonly classified based on their characteristics:

### **1.2.1 Classification by Fading**
1. **Flat Fading**:

       - All frequency components of the signal experience the same fading.
       - Occurs when the channel bandwidth is much larger than the signal bandwidth.

2. **Frequency-Selective Fading**:

       - Different frequency components experience different fading.
       - Caused by multipath propagation with delay spread larger than the signal's symbol duration.

### **1.2.2 Classification by Time Variability**
1. **Fast Fading**:

       - Channel changes rapidly within the symbol duration.
       - Caused by high mobility or large Doppler spread.

2. **Slow Fading**:

       - Channel remains constant over several symbol durations.
       - Results from slow environmental changes.

### **1.2.3 Classification by LOS/NLOS**
1. **Line-of-Sight (LOS)**:

       - Direct path exists between transmitter and receiver.
       - Typically observed in free-space or rural environments.

2. **Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS)**:

       - No direct path due to obstructions.
       - Common in urban and indoor environments.

---

## **1.3 Common Channel Models**
### **1.3.1 Free-Space Path Loss Model**
- **Description**:

      - Idealized model for LOS communication.
      - Path loss is proportional to the square of the distance.

- **Path Loss Formula**:

  $$
  PL(d) = 20 \log_{10}(d) + 20 \log_{10}(f) + 20 \log_{10}(\frac{4\pi}{c}) \quad (\text{dB})
  $$

  where \(d\) denotes distance (in meters), \(f\) denotes frequency (in Hz), and \(c\) denotes the speed of light (in m/s).

### **1.3.2 Rayleigh Fading Model**
- **Description**:

      - Assumes no dominant LOS path.
      - Signal amplitude follows a Rayleigh distribution.

- **Applications**:

      - Urban environments with dense scatterers.

- **Probability Density Function (PDF)**:

  $$
  f_R(r) = \frac{r}{\sigma^2} e^{-r^2 / (2\sigma^2)}, \quad r \geq 0
  $$

### **1.3.3 Rician Fading Model**
- **Description**:

      - Incorporates both LOS and scattered components.
      - Signal amplitude follows a Rician distribution.

- **Applications**:

      - Environments with a strong LOS component (e.g., highways, rural areas).

- **PDF**:
  $$
  f_R(r) = \frac{r}{\sigma^2} e^{-(r^2 + A^2) / (2\sigma^2)} I_0\left(\frac{Ar}{\sigma^2}\right), \quad r \geq 0
  $$

  where \(A\) denotes amplitude of the LOS component, and \(I_0\) denotes modified Bessel function of the first kind.

### **1.3.4 Log-Normal Shadowing Model**
- **Description**:

      - Models large-scale signal variations due to shadowing.
      - Shadowing effects are modeled as a Gaussian random variable in dB scale.

- **Path Loss with Shadowing**:
  $$
  PL(d) = PL_0 + 10\beta \log_{10}(d/d_0) + X_\sigma
  $$
  
  where \(PL_0\) denotes path loss at reference distance \(d_0\), and \(X_\sigma\) denotes zero-mean Gaussian random variable with standard deviation \(\sigma\).
